I will documenting all what i did and learn at this file, so maybe you can find something intresting.

First you have to do is install or add three js to your project and you can now got to the official website 
```
https://threejs.org
```

I learn form that official website, so you can just follow the documentation correctly.

The First thing i want to documenting is, when you gonna create 3d object using canvas you can actually create canvas inside your html body, this is because
the better configuration for the coming on, so wehn you want to configure it you can actually access directly those canvas using id tag, so i migth be better
to create 3d object, but actually three js can manually manage the canvas.
